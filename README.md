3. Choose the ZIP file and click **Install Now**
4. Click **Activate Plugin**

### Method 2: Manual FTP Upload

2. Upload the `acf-location-shortcodes` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
3. Go to **Plugins** in WordPress admin
4. Find and activate "ACF Location Shortcodes"

### Method 3: Git Clone (For Developers)

```bash
cd wp-content/plugins/
git clone https://github.com/rreiffenberger/acf-location-shortcodes.git
```

Then activate via WordPress admin or WP-CLI:
```bash
wp plugin activate acf-location-shortcodes
```

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

The plugin requires **Advanced Custom Fields** to function. If ACF is not installed:

1. Go to **Plugins > Add New**
2. Search for "Advanced Custom Fields"
3. Install and activate ACF Free (or ACF Pro if you have it)

### Step 2: Configure ACF Fields

Create a field group for your `location` post type with these fields:

**Required Field:**
- `surrounding_community_list` (Text) - Comma-separated list of communities

**Recommended Optional Fields:**
- `service_area_shorthand` (Text) - e.g., "Sioux Falls, SD"
- `address` (Text) - Physical address (empty = service area)
- `phone_number` (Text) - Contact number
- `servicing_physical_location` (Post Object) - Parent physical location

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for complete field schema.

### Step 3: Create Your First Location

1. Go to your location post type (e.g., **Service Area > Add New**)
2. Enter a title: "Sioux Falls"
3. Fill in "Surrounding Community List": `Brooks Harbor, Eagle Run, Shadow Wood`
4. Add other location details (address, phone, etc.)
5. Publish

### Step 4: Use the Shortcode

Add this to any page or post:

```
[location_communities location_id="123"]
```

Replace `123` with your actual location post ID. Or use on the location post itself:

```
[location_communities]
```

**Expected Output:**
> üè† Brooks Harbor  üè† Eagle Run  üè† Shadow Wood

### Step 5: Enable Debug Mode (Optional)

For troubleshooting, add to your `wp-config.php`:

```php
define( 'ACF_LS_DEBUG', true );
```

This enables verbose error messages with helpful debugging information (only visible to users with edit permissions).

## ACF Field Schema

This plugin is designed to work with a `location` custom post type. Your theme or another plugin should register this post type.

### Required Fields

| Field Name | Field Type | Description | Example |
|------------|------------|-------------|---------|
| `surrounding_community_list` | Text | Comma-separated list of communities | `Brooks Harbor, Eagle Run, Shadow Wood` |

### Optional Fields

| Field Name | Field Type | Description | Example |
|------------|------------|-------------|---------|
| `service_area_shorthand` | Text | Short display name | `Sioux Falls, SD` |
| `address` | Text | Physical address (empty = service area) | `123 Main St, Sioux Falls, SD 57104` |
| `phone_number` | Text | Contact phone number | `(605) 555-1234` |
| `servicing_physical_location` | Post Object | Parent physical location | (relationship to another location post) |
| `full_service_area_name` | Text | Full regional name | `Greater Sioux Falls Metropolitan Area` |
| `metro_area_name` | Text | Metro area | `Sioux Falls Metro` |
| `county_name` | Text | County | `Minnehaha County` |
| `located_near` | Text | Nearby landmark | `Near Falls Park` |
| `team_members_assigned` | Relationship | Assigned team members | (relationship to team member posts) |

**Physical Location Logic:**
- Posts WITH an `address` field value = Physical Location
- Posts WITHOUT an `address` field = Service Area

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for complete field reference and setup instructions.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**‚ùì Shortcode shows raw text instead of output**
- Ensure the plugin is activated
- Verify ACF is installed and active
- Check that you're using the correct shortcode syntax

**‚ùì "Invalid location ID" error**
- Verify the location post ID is correct
- Ensure the post type is `location`
- Check that the post is published

**‚ùì "No communities found" error**
- Add content to the `surrounding_community_list` field
- Ensure it's a comma-separated list
- Check field name matches exactly

**‚ùì Elementor filtering not working**
- Verify the relationship field name is correct
- Ensure posts have locations assigned
- Check that ACF field is a Relationship or Post Object type

**‚ùì Debug Information**

Enable debug mode in `wp-config.php`:
```php
define( 'ACF_LS_DEBUG', true );
```

This will show detailed error messages with:
- Post IDs and types
- Available fields
- Edit links to fix issues
- Suggested solutions

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for more troubleshooting tips.
