## Quick Start Guide

### üîå Step 1: Install Dependencies

The plugin requires **Advanced Custom Fields** to function. If ACF is not installed:

1. Go to **Plugins > Add New**
2. Search for "Advanced Custom Fields"
3. Install and activate ACF Free (or ACF Pro if you have it)

### üì• Step 2: Import ACF Field Groups

This plugin includes pre-configured field groups ready to import:

1. Go to **ACF > Tools**
2. Click on **Import Field Groups** tab
3. Choose File: Select `acf-export-2025-10-28.json` from the plugin directory
4. Click **Import JSON**

This will create:
- ‚úÖ **Location Details** field group (11 fields for service locations)
- ‚úÖ **Team Member Details** field group (4 fields for team members)
- ‚úÖ **Service Locations** post type
- ‚úÖ **Team Members** post type
- ‚úÖ **Team Member Types** taxonomy

### üìç Step 3: Create Your First Location

1. Go to **Service Locations > Add New**
2. **Title:** Enter city name (e.g., "Sioux Falls")
3. **Service Area Shorthand:** `Sioux Falls, SD`
4. **Surrounding Community List:** `Brooks Harbor, Eagle Run, Shadow Wood, Charleswood`
5. **Physical Address:** (Enter if physical location, leave empty if service area only)
6. Add other fields as needed
7. **Publish**

### üöÄ Step 4: Use Shortcodes

Add to any page or post:

```shortcode
[location_communities location_id="123"]
```

Or on the location post itself:

```shortcode
[location_communities]
[location_info field="service_area_shorthand"]
[location_list location_specific="true"]
```

**Expected Output:**
> üè† Brooks Harbor  üè† Eagle Run  üè† Shadow Wood  üè† Charleswood

### üêõ Step 5: Enable Debug Mode (Optional)

For troubleshooting, add to your `wp-config.php`:

```php
define( 'ACF_LS_DEBUG', true );
```

This enables verbose error messages with helpful debugging information (only visible to users with edit permissions).

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Location Landing Page

```html
<h1>[location_info field="full_service_area_name"]</h1>
<p>Serving [location_info field="county_name"] and the [location_info field="metro_area_name"]</p>

<h2>Communities We Serve</h2>
[location_communities limit="10"]

<h2>Our Service Locations</h2>
[location_list location_specific="true"]

<h3>Contact Us</h3>
<p>Phone: [location_info field="phone_number"]</p>
<p>Located near: [location_info field="located_near"]</p>
```

### Example 2: Location Directory Page

```
<h2>Our Physical Office Locations</h2>
[location_list type="physical" orderby="title"]

<h2>Service Areas</h2>
[location_list type="service" orderby="title"]
```

### Example 3: Team Members by Location (Elementor)

## ACF Field Schema

This plugin includes a complete ACF export file (`acf-export-2025-10-28.json`) ready to import. It creates:

### Post Types

#### Service Locations (`location`)
- **Purpose:** Physical locations and service areas
- **Permalink:** `/locations/{post-name}`
- **Features:** Title, editor, author, revisions, thumbnail
- **Icon:** üìç Dashicons Store

#### Team Members (`team-member`)
- **Purpose:** Staff and team member profiles
- **Permalink:** `/people/{post-name}`
- **Features:** Title, revisions
- **Icon:** üë• Dashicons Admin Users

### Taxonomies

#### Team Member Types (`team-member-type`)
- **Purpose:** Categorize team members (e.g., Doctor, Nurse, Admin)
- **Hierarchical:** Yes
- **Assigned To:** `team-member` post type

### Location Field Group (11 Fields)

| Field Name | Field Type | Required | Description | Example |
|------------|------------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `service_area_shorthand` | Text | No | Short service area name | `Sioux Falls, SD` |
| `address` | Text | No | Physical address (determines location type) | `123 Main St, Sioux Falls, SD 57104` |
| `phone_number` | Text | No | Contact phone (shown if address exists) | `(605) 555-1234` |
| `location_site_url` | URL | No | Dedicated location website | `https://siouxfalls.example.com` |
| `servicing_physical_location` | Post Object | No | Parent physical location (shown if no address) | (relationship to location post) |
| `full_service_area_name` | Text | No | Full regional name | `Sioux Falls & The Sioux Empire` |
| `located_near` | Text | No | Nearby landmark | `Near Falls Park` |
| `metro_area_name` | Text | No | Metropolitan area | `Sioux Falls Metro` |
| `county_name` | Text | No | County name | `Minnehaha County` |
| `surrounding_community_list` | Text | No | Comma-separated communities | `Brooks Harbor, Eagle Run, Shadow Wood` |
| `team_members_assigned` | Relationship | No | Assigned team members | (relationship to team-member posts) |

### Team Member Field Group (4 Fields)

| Field Name | Field Type | Required | Description | Example |
|------------|------------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `profile_picture` | Image | No | Team member photo | (image file) |

**Physical Location Logic:**
- Location WITH `address` field value = **Physical Location**
- Location WITHOUT `address` field = **Service Area** (must set `servicing_physical_location`)

**Import Instructions:**
1. Go to **ACF > Tools**
2. Select **Import Field Groups** tab
3. Choose `acf-export-2025-10-28.json` from plugin directory
4. Click **Import JSON**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**‚ùì Shortcode shows raw text instead of output**
- Ensure the plugin is activated
- Verify ACF is installed and active
- Check that you're using the correct shortcode syntax

**‚ùì "Invalid location ID" error**
- Verify the location post ID is correct
- Ensure the post type is `location`
- Check that the post is published

**‚ùì "No communities found" error**
- Add content to the `surrounding_community_list` field
- Ensure it's a comma-separated list
- Check field name matches exactly

**‚ùì Elementor filtering not working**
- Verify the relationship field name is correct
- Ensure posts have locations assigned
- Check that ACF field is a Relationship or Post Object type

**‚ùì Debug Information**

Enable debug mode in `wp-config.php`:
```php
define( 'ACF_LS_DEBUG', true );
```

This will show detailed error messages with:
- Post IDs and types
- Available fields
- Edit links to fix issues
- Suggested solutions
